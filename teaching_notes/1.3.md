# Lesson 1.3

## Concepts covered

- Props
- State
- Handler function
- Callback functions

## Observations

- book is working with tenuous definitions
  - "handler function" is a callback
  - "callback" is a callback passed through props

## Lecture talking points

### Props

- information from parent component for child component to use (how parent communicates with child)
- called "props" for properties. Potentially includes children elements if any are placed between opening and closing tags.

### State

- data that describes the values being used inside the app.

### Handler function in JSX

- HTML + JS uses event handlers: addEventListener(type, listener)
  - events eg: "click", "resize", "keyup"
  - listener is callback function that does something when event fires on target
- React uses synthetic events that closely mirror regular events but normalized across browsers to minimize behavioral variations
  - conventionally named with "on" prefix then camelCase
  - ? maybe something about bubble vs capture phases
- The "handler function" is the callback function that is called when the synthetic event is triggered
  - defined inline or outside of jsx then provided as a value for the event listener (differentiate between giving a function as a value vs a function's return value)
  - inline: `onClick={(evt) => console.log(evt.target.value)}`
  - as reference w/o args: `onClick={printHi}`
  - as reference w/args: `onClick=((evt) => printEvent(evt))`
  - don't invoke a function inside an event listener unless it returns a function
