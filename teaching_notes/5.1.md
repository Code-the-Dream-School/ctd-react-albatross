# Lesson 5.1

## Concepts covered

- Sorting
- Searching
- Pagination

## Observations

- not really React-specific- more along common tasks done in web apps
- dislike using API sort rather than local- excessive network requests to enable app functionality.

## Lecture talking points

### Sorting

- on load - intercept data from endpoint and sort before useStore.
- on load - allow API to do it based on their docs. This app uses Airtable which takes url query params
- render time - chain sort onto map
- user-initiated - callback handler + setState
  - Todo app toggles between 2 variations (asc, desc) - NOTE: I disagree with approach of querying API to have it sort data for us unless it is a collaborative todo list expecting frequent upgrades from different users.
  - If multiple ways to sort are needed, take advantage of a lookup object.
- consider query options if using React Router

### Searching

- consider query options if using React Router

### Pagination

- Don't want to return hundreds/k's/mil's (Picture Google result showing ALL hits!)
- Groupings sensible for app- 10,20,100
- Dependent on API implementation for specifics
  - Some query-based
  - Others automatically paginate

## Potential concept demo ideas

- long list sort (local)
- long list search
- complex filter
- leveraging Router

## Todo list instructions call-outs

- References TodoContainer.js which does not exist prior to this lesson.
