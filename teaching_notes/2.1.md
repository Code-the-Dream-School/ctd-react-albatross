# Lesson 2.1

## Concepts covered

- Class components
- Class component state

## Observations

## Lecture talking points

### Class components

- Used as state component before React Hooks introduced on React 16.8 (Feb 2019)
  - Used as stateful parent component to presentation components which were function-based but missing any state management like useState, useRef, ect.
- Fell out of favor with many when hooks introduced but still common. Found in older code bases and with developers that prefer a OOP approach to programming. (Angular and Express OOP)
- call out use of `this` and `.bind` with class-based properties/methods (arrow functions don't need these :-) )
- uses lifecycle including methods
  - componentDidMount - run stuff when component created(network requests, etc)
  - componentDidUpdate - run stuff when component reloads
  - componentWillUnmount - run cleanup code when component is un-mounted (timers, event listeners, cancel network requests, close opened connections)

### Topic 2

- setState() - establishes values for the component
- forceUpdate() - React may not see an update a 3rd party library performed on data or display info

## Potential concept demo ideas

- show old flatiron code- should use ph5 project, RecipeBook

## Todo list instructions call-outs

- [Reference](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html)

## End of lesson app capabilities/features

App should function the same as when it started.
