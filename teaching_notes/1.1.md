# Lesson 1.1

## Concepts covered

- Intro to React
- Project setup
- Components
- JSX
- List in React

## Observations

- Create React App one way to set up React project- many others but this beginner friendly. Another easy option is Vite using the React template
- Installation
  - npx runs scripts over the internet without having to install them locally first
  - npm (Node Package Manager) and npx are installed alongside Node
  - yarn is another package manager that is similar to npm
- typing `yarn run` in an installed project will give you a list of commands that are available in package.json
