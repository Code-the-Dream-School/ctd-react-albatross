# Lesson 1.7

## Concepts covered

- Async data
- Conditional rendering
- Advanced state
- Impossible state

## Observations

- Promise...resolve is more difficult to wrap your head around than fetch
  - BUT the underlying technology of fetch is Promise!
  - [JS Promises: an intro](https://web.dev/promises/)
  - [States and Fates](https://github.com/domenic/promises-unwrapping/blob/master/docs/states-and-fates.md)

## Lecture talking points

### Async data

- Allows for time-expensive processes (fetching data) to be non-blocking

### Conditional rendering

- Evaluate the condition of a particular evaluation then use it to decide whether to render something
  - inline with ternary
  - separate function that returns jsx (if/then, switch/case/default, etc)
  - React accepts `null` and will do nothing
- Nice for user interface to show a "loading" status
- Hide resources for certain types of users
  - Links/ resources available for only logged in users
  - Login form for those who are not logged in (makes no sense to show a login form when someone is already logged in)

### Advanced state

- useReducer- good for complex state structures (think redux)

### Impossible state

- multiple useStates can end up causing problems when useEffect is introduced, especially when having to handle errors. Should a promise reject, depending on how the useState's have been implemented, there could be a conflict (eg- a fetch fails but an error message is never able to be shown because a "loading" indicator state does not get changed on a success.)
- more info about how to use useReducer

## Potential concept demo ideas

- practical useReducer scenario
- conditional rendering- have a "complete task" button strike through task then exposes a "hide all completed tasks" button
- if field empty and isLoading, disable submit

## Todo list instructions call-outs

- the new useEffect with the Promise is muddy AF
  - The promise should be given, instructions should be re-worded, or a brief explanation of a Promise and its composition should be provided.
- programmer set up for frustration by allowing then to experience dueling useEffects before warning them

## End of lesson app capabilities/features

- Todo list will load from local storage after 2 seconds, until it does, a loading message will show on the screen
- adding todos will not work until time has elapsed
