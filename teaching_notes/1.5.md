# Lesson 1.6

## Concepts covered

- Side-effects
- Custom hooks
- React fragments

## Observations

- need to look deeper into cleanup useEffect
- custom hooks is a weak spot for me

## Lecture talking points

### Side-effects

- Need way for the React app to interact with the outside world
  - CRUD data from API
  - Interact with browser storage (Cookies, SessionStorage, IndexedDb, etc.)
  - Interact with DOM outside of using React (some 3rd party libraries need to directly manipulate the DOM)
- Consists of 2 parts
  - function that does work
  - array of state values to listen to
    - when any of the values listed change, useEffect re-runs
    - empty array will run only when component mounts
    - no array means effect will run every time component renders
- Always runs when component mounts (explain React 18's x2 mount)
- multiple useEffect can be used

### Custom hooks

- don't call hooks from normal function
  - can be called in highest level of functional component
  - can be called inside another hook
  - eslint-plugin-react-hooks can lint for violations

### React fragments

- JSX restricts return statements to return only a single top-level dom element.
- Up until now, you've been wrapping things in a div or some other single element
- Fragment allows the developer to return multiple dom elements on the same level
- longhand: `<React.Fragment><bunch/><of/><sibling/><elements/><React.Fragment />`
- shorthand is `<><bunch/><of/><sibling/><elements/></>`
- "disappears" when the JSX renders out HTML

## Potential concept demo ideas

- demo useEffect's optional array
  - empty
  - one, multiple values
  - no array
- show how fragments disappear
- make a custom hook

## Todo list instructions call-outs

- The custom hook is a leap of logic and may require additional hand-holding

## End of lesson app capabilities/features

- app loads saved todos from local storage
- can add new items which automatically get saved back
