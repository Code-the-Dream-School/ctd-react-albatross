# Lesson 1.6

## Concepts covered

- Side-effects
- Custom hooks
- React fragments

## Observations

- need to look deeper into cleanup useEffect
- custom hooks is a weak spot for me

## Lecture talking points

### Side-effects

- Need way for the React app to interact with the outside world
  - CRUD data from API
  - Interact with browser storage (Cookies, SessionStorage, IndexedDb, etc.)
  - Interact with DOM outside of using React (some 3rd party libraries need to directly manipulate the DOM)
- Consists of 2 parts
  - function that does work
  - array of state values to listen to
    - when any of the values listed change, useEffect re-runs
    - empty array will run only when component mounts
    - no array means effect will run every time component renders
- Always runs when component mounts (explain React 18's x2 mount)
- multiple useEffect can be used

### Custom hooks

- don't call hooks from normal function
  - can be called in highest level of functional component
  - can be called inside another hook
  - eslint-plugin-react-hooks can lint for violations

### React fragments

## Potential concept demo ideas

- demo useState's

## Todo list instructions call-outs
