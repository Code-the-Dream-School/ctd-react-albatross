# Lesson 4.1

## Concepts covered

- Performance in React
- TypeScript in React
- Testing in React
- React project structure

## Observations

- TODO: observe re-renders while typing into a controlled form
  - RtR wk15 p5

## Lecture talking points

### Performance in react

- be mindful of what useEffect updates on with 2nd arg
  - empty array: once only (technically x2) <React.useStrict>
  - no array: run every time component updates
  - tie into useRef is you want to avoid running on 1st render
- useMemo (need to do research!)
- useCallback (need to do research!)

### Typescript in React

- installed by default in VS Code.
- Other text editors may need plugins.
- For developers
  - reveals errors while developing
  - allows them to understand expected inputs/outputs, object schemas
  - adds transpile step because browser only understands JS
    - strips typing info out
    - transpile vs compile
- @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest
- [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped)
- rename .js -> ts, .jsx -> tsx

### Testing in React (need to learn!!)

- Unit, Integration, E2E
- Jest

### Project Structure

- Separation of concerns
- Group like w/ like &or by feature
- Centralize reusable portions of code
- Honor existing codebase

## Potential concept demo ideas

- demo useState w/useRef to prevent 1st run out of the gate
  - *AddTodoForm button className logs to console*
- difference in/out of strict mode
- example unit tests

## Todo list instructions call-outs
