# Lesson 1.2

## Concepts covered

- Components
- Component instantiation
- React DOM
- Component declaration

## Observations

- Book titles are hairy and dis-ordered
  - I like the order
    - Components
    - ReactDOM
    - C. declaration
    - C. instantiation

## Lecture talking points

### Components

- Encapsulation and re-use
- Component tree and relational hierarchy
  - "App", "root", "entry point"
  - root/ancestor component
  - descendants: children, siblings
  - leaf - don't have descendants

### Declaration, instantiation

- declaration = writing a function or class
  - establish its existence by defining its properties and behaviors
  - basic functional component anatomy
    - component naming conventions
    - export
      - export or not to export
      - named export vs default (why I prefer named)
    - `props`
    - function declaration, arrow function expression
      - conciseness, implicit return of arrow function
      - convert to explicit return so other work can performed before return
      - where/how to perform calculations
      - make decision on convention and stick with it
    - mandatory return statement
    - working with js outside component
- instantiation = putting component into use; calling it
  - formatting as element
  - `props`
  - `children`
  
### React DOM

- App component, aka root aka entry-point
- react-dom library
- Re-iterate ReactDOM.render vs root render
- TODO: flesh this section out!

## Potential concept demo ideas

- tree is a must- try for visualizations
- how to work with `children`- how they disappear if not accounted for
- converting function decl to arrow function expression
- converting implicit return to explicit
- dev tooling - emmet an snippets

## Todo list instructions call-outs

- instruction to move JSX to TodoList component needs better wording- only the ul and its dependencies get moved (it gets spelled out properly as you read on but this needs to get indicated better)
- submit button should be inside form element and given type="submit"
  - is is opposed to using an input with type submit which is more appropriate

## End of lesson app capabilities/features

- Todo list renders same as previously, still static
- added form containing a label, input and button
  - form does not do anything but can field can be typed in
  - when button pressed, page will refresh (this is undesired but will be fixed) which will clear out the input
