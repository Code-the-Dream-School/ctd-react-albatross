# Lesson 3.1

## Concepts covered

- Styling in React
- CSS in React
- CSS modules in React

## Observations

## Lecture talking points

- organization and consistency is key
  - pay close attention to scope (generic styles in modules affect all components)
  - keep component-specific styles close to components
  - re-usable styles should be aggregated
  - scss common and worth exploring
- utility classes good for going "fast" if you know them well
- styled components very powerful but more difficult to organize at scale (my preferred)

### Styling in React

### CSS in React

- inline styles: valid js object w/camelCase css property and quote-encapsulated values
  - interpolate into element using styles={someStyleObj}
  - className set to string. Imported into component's file or globally

### CSS modules in React

- className property on imported styles module

## Potential concept demo ideas

- demonstrate specificity that results from different approaches
