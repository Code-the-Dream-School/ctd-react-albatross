# Info

This repo starts with CRA installed. Each branch represents the completed work for a particular unit. The exception to that is the project-start branch. This branch represents CRA installed but before changing the project from using ReactDOM.render to root.render. I will be doing this immediately in lesson 1.1.

## Use Yarn

Though I usually use NPM out of habit, the students are instructed to use yarn.

## Each weeks' notes

Each of the teaching notes include the basic concepts covered that week's material. As I build through the project, I'll take note of confusing or erroneous instructions. I will also include supplementary material and ideas for additional demos for each concept. Focus on the how's and why's, especially when it comes to pitfalls.

I'll also include a description of what the app should be doing by the end of the lesson. This is something that the course materials really needs so students are comfortable with their own work.
