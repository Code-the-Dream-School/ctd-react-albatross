# Welcome to the Albatross React Class!  

### During class you will be building **TWO** React apps...

The **FIRST** will be a **BLOG APP** that you build while working through the class textbook.
The blog app you will create completely from scratch following the book instructions.  _You should keep your work for the blog app in a separate repository._  

The **SECOND** will be a **TO-DO LIST APP** that you will build as extra coding practice during your coding assignments throughout the class.
